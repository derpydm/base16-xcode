# Base16 for Xcode (8+)

This template allows the Base16 builder to create Base16 color themes for Xcode 8+.
See the [Base16 repository](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for more information.

**Please note** that this color template (`templates/default.mustache`) doesn't yet work with the vanilla Base16 builder spec. See chriskempson/base16#48 for more information.

Here are two examples, using Tomorrow and Tomorrow Night:
